            and lecturer. She was the first deaf-blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. The story 
            of Keller and her teacher, Anne Sullivan, was made famous by Keller's autobiography, The Story
            of My Life, and its adaptations for film and stage, The Miracle Worker. Her birthplace in West 
            Tuscumbia, Alabama, is now a museum and sponsors an annual "Helen Keller Day". Her June 27
            birthday is commemorated as Helen Keller Day in Pennsylvania and, in the centenary year of her
            birth, was recognized by a presidential proclamation from US President Jimmy Carter.<br>
        
            A prolific author, Keller was well-traveled and outspoken in her convictions. A member of the 
            Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, she campaigned for women's 
            suffrage, labor rights, socialism, antimilitarism, and other similar causes. She was inducted 
            into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1971 and was one of twelve inaugural inductees to the 
            Alabama Writers Hall of Fame on June 8, 2015.</p>

            <p class="tribute-info" style="padding: 5px 50px 50px 50px;margin:auto; font-style: oblique;font-weight: bolder;">The few own the many because they possess the means of livelihood of all ... The country is governed for the richest, for the corporations, the bankers, the land speculators, and for the exploiters of labor. The majority of mankind are working people. So long as their fair demands—the ownership and control of their livelihoods—are set at naught, we can have neither men's rights nor women's rights. The majority of mankind is ground down by industrial oppression in order that the small remnant may live in ease.
